## Work in Progress  

Hi, my name is Benjamin Post, I started a PhD in Systems Ecology in June 2017 enrolled at the Jacobs-University in Bremen, 
employed at ZMT (Leibniz-Centre for Tropical Marine Research).

This is the repository where I will keep all code related to my PhD thesis openly accessible to anyone. 
As I am still within the preliminary phase of the first manuscript, it might still take some time until the file structure and content will make sense to an outsider. 
Please contact me if you have any questions.
