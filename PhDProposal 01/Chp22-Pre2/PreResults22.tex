General intro sentence" 

why would this be interesting to anyone else


movement towards open source programming languages

Open Source, Open Access, Open Science!
comparability

teach PhD Students from the ground up to code their own models in Python, as of yet there is a lack of coherent ressources. Definitely cite the PhytoMFTM model and publication \citep{AcevedoTrejos2016}

\section{How to complete this project}


Just say that this model was the basis for the previous chapter work, and will be for the rest of my PhD, a toolkit for testing ideas with multiple functional types! go towards selection-based models, like DARWIN
and how the allow to change the biodiversity explicitly, to test hypothesis
