\subsection{BDEF}

 HERE I should cite the Tilman and Ptacnik Papers that Esteban recommended, talk about how Biodiversity influences ressource use efficiency
 
ALSO BDEF MODEL BY LOREAU: \citep{Loreau1998b}
 
 And then say how the model I am building is actually very well equipped to deal with this kind of

\section{Relevance}
Again talk shortly about how biodiversity means ecosystem resilience (kinda) and how climate change and anthropogenic stressors will test, if not break the boundaries of the ecosystem resilience.
