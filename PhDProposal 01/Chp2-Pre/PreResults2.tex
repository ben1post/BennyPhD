\section{Regime shift in the Cariaco Basin}
The CARIACO time-series has been collecting detailed data on the phytoplankton community in the Cariaco Basin from 1995 to 2017 (see Section \ref{CARIACOintro} for a full description). What has been a particular focus of the research based on this data set is the apparent changes in environmental conditions documented in both the physical boundary conditions as well as the biological data. 
As documented by \citet{Taylor2012}

and further investigated by \citet{Pinckney2015}

Interesting thing is that there was this shift in the PhytoplanktonCommunity but apparently no real reduction in Export! (This is in Taylor and Pinckney somehwere)
this would be coherent with Pinckney, no real reduction in biomass, but shifts in the community and towards greater depth, talk about depth of the euphotic zone! also have that data thanks to JP and CBN

The term regime shift is actually not very well defined and has been used... \citep{DeYoung2004a}
There are global trends and indications of a regime shift, but methods to identify regime shifts are not well established and have been critically discussed in the literature \citep{Steele2004a, Mantua2004a, Litzow2016a}. To my knowledge no formal exploration of a potential regime shift has been performed with the CARIACO data, therefore the term regime shift is used here to describe the observed changes in the phytoplankton community and physical environment without presupposing a formally defined state shift in the entire ecosystem.

Talk about the data again

Also talk about mutshinda et al studies!
Mutshinda study one, bayesian approach: \cite{Mutshinda2013a}

Mutshinda study, same year, environmental factors: \cite{Mutshinda2013}

culminated in the study in PNAS: "Phytoplankton adapt to a changing environment" \cite{Irwin2015}

detailed phytoplankton data has been used in the previous studies for statistical analysis, but surprisingly not yet for ecosystem or trait-based modeling
This will be a first! first proper ecological model apart from this Export Flux model only including diatoms \citep{Walsh2002a}

FUNCTIONAL TYPES STRUCTURE --> explain linkage between Pigment Data that I use and functional diversity measurements (XMoreno et al. 2012X) take this from Pinckney et al. 2015...
Thus, photopigment-based measures offer an efficient way to quantify community or functional diversity (X Moreno et al., 2012 X). (From Pinckney et al 2015) ..> this would also be good to discuss in part 4!

EXPLAIN THE HYPOTHESES HERE; AND HOW THEY CAN BE TESteD

Main hypothesis, based on top down and bottom up processes:
Top down grazing has great influence on ecosystem, not just from biomass, but also biodiversity aspects \cite{Prowe2012c}.

Most models built for temperate oceans, since that is where reasearch (and funding) has been most well developed. Fasham NPZD type slabe physics explain.
Why won't this fit well in the Cariaco setting? - mostly due to shallow and comparatively invariable MLD, and nutrient fluxes don't correlate.
Problem of nutrient forcing! If MLD driven, nutrients below MLD are highly variable, only below 100m do we get towards a relatively constant N0 and Si0 (can show plots here!)

{\bf {\large A1. CARIACO model description}} 

NPZD models are simplified marine ecosystem models that can be adapted to different physical settings and food web structures. For this model, the basic structure is inspired by the models of Fasham (1990) as it was adapted by Anderson et al. (2015). The pyhsical setting of the model uses a zero-dimensional slab structure as originally presented in Evans and Parslow (1985) and adapted from Acevedo-Trejos et al. (2015) where the ecosystem is described within a seasonally varying surface mixed layer above a deep homogenous layer. The code structure is the PhytoMFTM model written in the open source programming language Python, which provides a flexible framework for NPZD-type models with multiple functional types of phytoplankton and zooplankton. The model code and all statistical scripts are available publicly on Github (\url{https://github.com/ben1post/BennyPhD}).

The model framework was adapted to the setting of the CARIACO time-series in the Cariaco basin of the coast of Venezuela. The data includes phytoplankton species counts and two size-classes of zooplankton, which were included in the model as the 4 most prominent phytoplankton types, and 2 zooplankton types. The phytoplankton types include Nanoflagellates $P_{n}$, Diatoms $P_{dt}$, Coccolithophores, $P_{c}$ and Dinoflagellates $P_{dn}$. There are two Zooplankton types split by size class, named Mikrozooplankton $Z_{\mu}$ and Mesozooplankton $Z_{\lambda}$. 

Nitrogen $N$ (and Silicate $Si$ for Diatoms) is assimilated by the phytoplankton types $P_i$, which are grazed by the zooplankton types $Z_j$. Mortality of and excretion from phytoplankton and zooplankton, and sloppy feeding by zooplankton contribute to Detritus $D$. In addition to the linear mortality of $P_i$ and $Z_j$, there is an additional quadratic mortality term acting on $Z_j$, which represents higher-order predation on zooplankton.

{\bf {\large A1.1 Physical setting}}

The ecosystem component of the model is set within a zero-dimensional physical environment. The water column is divided into a 2-layer structure. A depth variable layer (e.g. the thermo- and/or pycnocline) separates a well-mixed surface layer containing the ecosystem component from a homogenous deep ocean. Concentrations of nutrients are averaged across the mixed layer, and remain constant below.  There is no lateral advection, but vertical mixing is modeled as a function of mixed layer depth (MLD) over time $M(t)$. Temperature depth profiles have been used to reconstruct the MLD at the investigated location. The derivative of MLD over time is given as $h(t) = dM(t)$. Exchange between the two layers is described by the two processes of turbulent diffusion and entrainment or detrainment caused by a shallowing or deepening of MLD. Adapted from Fasham (1993), the effects of entrainment and detrainment on nutrients, phytoplankton and detritus are given by the term $h^{+}(t)= max[h(t),0]$. Zooplankton is assumed to be able to maintain themselves within the mixed layer depth, therefore entrainment and detrainment of $Z_j$ are described by $h(t)$. Diffusive mixing between the layers has been parameterized with a constant factor $k$. The entire diffusion term is thus
\begin{equation}
\kappa = \frac{k + h^{+}(t)}{M(t)}
\end{equation}
In addition to the MLD interpolated from time series data, the model is externally forced with sea surface temperature (SST) taken from in situ data and interpolated from monthly to daily values and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from 8-day averaged SeaWIFs satellite data.

{\bf {\large A1.2 Phytoplankton}}

Phytoplankton growth is a function of light (PAR), temperature (SST) and nutrients. These factors are assumed to independently limit growth, so that (exemplary for $P_{d}$, i.e. diatoms) the growth term is
\begin{equation}
\mu_{d} = \mu_{d}^{max} \cdot U_{d}(N,Si)\cdot L_{d}(PAR)\cdot T_{d}(SST)
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{d}$ is the maximum growth rate per day and $T(PAR)$ is Eppleys formulation for temperature dependent growth (Eppley, 1972), given as $T(SST) = e^{0.063 * SST}$ with temperature in $^\circ C$. The light-limiting term $L(PAR)$ represents the integrated photosynthesis within the mixed layer as a function of incident irradiance at the surface $I_0$. Light attenuation is calculated using the Lambert-Beer law with irradiance at depth $z$ equal to
\begin{equation}
I(z) = I_0 \cdot e^{-k_{PAR} \cdot z}
\end{equation}
Here, $k_{PAR}$ is calculated as the sum of the constant attenuation coefficient of water $k_w$ and the self-shading of phytoplankton $k_c$ with the unit $\mu M^{-1}$ multiplied by total phytoplankton biomass $P$, i.e. $k_{PAR} = k_w + k_c P$. This model uses the Smith PI curve as a basis for the calculation, with $V_P$ representing the photosynthetic rate, $\alpha$, the initial slope of the PI curve and $V_p^{Max}$, the maximum photosynthetic rate
\begin{equation}
V_p = \frac{\alpha \cdot I \cdot V_p^{Max}} {\sqrt{(V_p^{Max})^2 + \alpha^2 \cdot I^2}}
\end{equation}
Combining equation (2) and (3) as presented in Anderson et al. (2015), the integrated photosynthesis $\bar{V}_p$ over depth $z$ is calculated as
\begin{equation}
\bar{V}_p(z) = \frac{V_p^{Max}}{k_{PAR} \cdot z} \cdot \ln \Bigg( \frac{\alpha \cdot I_0 + \sqrt{(V_p^{Max})^2+(\alpha \cdot I_0)^2}} {\alpha \cdot I(z) + \sqrt{(V_p^{Max})^2+(\alpha \cdot I(z))^2}} \Bigg)
\end{equation}
where $\bar{V}_p$ equals the light-limiting term $L$ in the growth equation (2).

Nutrient limited growth of the phytoplankton community is described via a Monod equation. 
\begin{equation}
U(N) = \frac{N} {k_N + N}
\end{equation}
For diatoms $P_d$ the nutrient limiting term depends on both nitrogen and silicate concentration within the upper layer. According to Liebig's law of the minimum, always the lower nutrient availability limits Diatom growth:
\begin{equation}
U_{d}(N,Si) = min \Big( \frac{N} {k_{d}^N + N}, \frac{Si} {k_{d}^{Si} + Si} \Big)
\end{equation}
All other phytoplankton types are nutrient-limited only by available Nitrogen as in equation (6). Phytoplankton mortality and excretion are parameterized as a linear constant rate $mo$. With $G_{\mu}$ as grazing by Microzooplankton and $G_{\lambda}$ as grazing by Mesozooplankton (defined below), the equations for all phytoplankton types $P_i$ can now be written as
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP_{i}}{dt} = \mu_{i} \cdot P_{i} - mo_{i} \cdot P - G_{\mu}(P_{i}) - G_{\lambda}(P_{i}) - \kappa \cdot P_{i}
\end{equation}

{\bf {\large A1.3 Zooplankton}}

Two zooplankton types are resolved in the model according to size-class, Microzooplankton $Z_{\mu}$ and Mesozooplankton $Z_{\lambda}$. Following Anderson et al. (2015) the grazing of, for example, $Z_{\lambda}$ on diatoms $P_d$ is formulated as follows

\begin{equation}
G_{\lambda}(P_{d}) = \Bigg( \frac{\mu^Z_{\lambda} \cdot \phi^{\lambda}_d \cdot P_d} 
							{(k^Z_{\lambda})^2 + \phi^{\lambda}_d \cdot P_d + \phi^{\lambda}_c \cdot P_c + \phi^{\lambda}_{df} \cdot P_{df} + \phi^{\lambda}_{n} \cdot P_{n} + \phi^{\lambda}_{\mu} \cdot Z_{\mu}} \Bigg) \cdot Z_{\lambda}
\end{equation}
$\phi^{\lambda}_{d}$ = $\rho^{\lambda}_{d} P_{d}$ , $\phi^{\lambda}_{c}$ = $\rho^{\lambda}_{c} P_{c}$ , $\phi^{\lambda}_{df}$ = $\rho^{\lambda}_{df} P_{df}$ , $\phi^{\lambda}_{n}$ = $\rho^{\lambda}_{n} P_{n}$ , $\phi^{\lambda}_{\mu}$ = $\rho^{\lambda}_{\mu} Z_{\mu}$

with $\mu^Z_{\lambda}$ as the maximum grazing rate, $k^Z_{\lambda}$ as the half saturation constant of grazing, $\phi^{\lambda}_{d}$ as the density dependent feeding preference of $Z_{\lambda}$ feeding on $P_d$, defined as $\rho_{d} \cdot P_{d}$, with $\rho^{\lambda}_{d}$ as the feeding preference coefficient.



{\bf {\large A1.x Solving method}}

The system of differential equations was solved numerically using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method in the odeint function of the scipy package in python 3.7. 

Physical forcing is interpolated ... Taken from the regimes ... etc.
