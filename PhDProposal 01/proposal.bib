abstract = {Trait diversity, a key component of biodiversity, mediates many essential ecosystem functions and services. However, the mechanisms behind such relationships at large spatial scales are not fully understood. Here we adopt the functional biogeography approach to investigate how the size composition of phytoplankton communities relates to primary production and export production along a broad latitudinal gradient. Using in situ phytoplankton size distribution data and a trait-based model, we find an increase in the average phytoplankton size, size diversity, primary production and export when moving from low to high latitudes. Our analysis indicates that the interplay between spatio-temporal heterogeneities in environmental conditions and a trade-off between the high affinity for nutrients of smaller cells and the ability to avoid predation by larger cells are the main mechanisms driving the observed patterns. Our results also suggest that variations in size diversity alone do not directly lead to changes in primary production and export. The trade-off thus introduces a feedback that influences the relationship between size diversity and ecosystem functions. These findings support the importance of environmentally mediated trade-offs as crucial mechanisms shaping biodiversity and ecosystem function relationships at large spatial scales.},

@article{Merico2009,
abstract = {Although predator-prey cycles can be easily predicted with mathematical models it is only since recently that oscillations observed in a chemostat predator-prey (rotifer-algal) experiment offer an interesting workbench for testing model soundness. These new observations have highlighted the limitations of the conventional modelling approach in correctly reproducing some unexpected characteristics of the cycles. Simulations are improved when changes in algal community structure, resulting from natural selection operating on an assemblage of algal clones differing in competitive ability and defence against rotifer predation, is considered in multi-prey models. This approach, however, leads to extra complexity in terms of state variables and parameters. We show here that multi-prey models with one predator can be effectively approximated with a simpler (only a few differential equations) model derived in the context of adaptive dynamics and obtained with a moment-based approximation. The moment-based approximation has been already discussed in the literature but mostly in a theoretical context, therefore we focus on the strength of this approach in downscaling model complexity by relating it to the chemostat predator-prey experiment. Being based on mechanistic concepts, our modelling framework can be applied to any community of competing species for which a trade-off between competitive ability and resistance to predators can be appropriately defined. We suggest that this approach can be of great benefit for reducing complexity in biogeochemical modelling studies at the basin or global ocean scale. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Hellweger2009,
abstract = {The individual-based (aka agent-based) approach is now well established in ecological modeling. Traditionally, most applications have been to organisms at higher trophic levels, where the importance of population heterogeneity (intra-population variability), complete life cycles and behavior adapted to internal and external conditions has been recognized for some time. However, advances in molecular biology and biochemistry have brought about an increase in the application of individual-based modeling (IBM) to microbes as well. This literature review summarizes 46 IBM papers for bacteria in wastewater treatment plants, phytoplankton in ocean and inland waters, bacteria in biofilms, bacteria in food and other environs, and "digital organisms" and "domesticated computer viruses" in silico. The use of IBM in these applications was motivated by population heterogeneity (45{\%}), emergence (24{\%}), absence of a continuum (5{\%}), and other unknown reasons (26{\%}). In general, the challenges and concepts of IBM modeling for microbes and higher trophic levels are similar. However, there are differences in the microbe population dynamics and their environment that create somewhat different challenges, which have led to somewhat different modeling concepts. Several topics are discussed, including producing, maintaining and changing population heterogeneity (different life histories, internal variability, positive feedback, inter-generation memory), dealing with very large numbers of individuals (different up-scaling methods, including representative space vs. super-individual, number vs. biomass based, discrete vs. continuous kinetics, various agent accounting methods), handling space, simulating interactions with the extracellular environment (hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian approach), modeling agent-agent interaction (self-shading, predation, shoving) and passive transport (random walk with spatially variable diffusivity, well-mixed reactors). Overall, the literature indicates that the application of IBM to microbes is developing into a mature field. However, several challenges remain, including simulating various types of agent-agent interactions (formation and function of colonies or filaments, sexual reproduction) and even smaller individuals (viruses, genes). Further increases in intracellular detail and complexity in microbe IBMs may be considered the combination of systems biology and systems ecology, or the new field of systems bioecology. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Hellweger2017a,
abstract = {The complexity of our mechanistic ecosystem (biogeochemical, eutrophication, phytoplankton, water quality) models has not changed substantially since they were developed in the 1970s. Consequently, there is now a large disconnect with contemporary problems (e.g., toxin production), knowledge of biological and ecological processes (e.g., intracellular mechanisms, sediment bed overwintering) and environmental observational technologies (e.g., metatransciptomics). This limits the utility of models for making predictions and supporting management. There are several reasons against increasing complexity, including (a) number of required assumptions, (b) risk of overfitting, (c) higher uncertainty, (d) missing knowledge, (e) lack of observations for calibration and validation and (f) difficulty of developing, running, analyzing and communicating the model. Here I review those arguments and conclude that, for mechanistic, predictive ecosystem modeling, they either do not apply, are not a significant problem in practice or can readily be solved by providing more resources to modelers. Further, a review of these issues leads to the conclusion that more complexity generally increases the predictive skill of a model, because more information is used to constrain it. This can be formulated as a new rule: more in, more out (MIMO). MIMO suggests that more complex models make better predictions, but this should not be adopted as a universal modeling strategy, because in practice, the difficulty associated with developing, understanding and communicating complex models has to be considered. However, those are problems readily solved by more resources and I argue that more funding needs to be made available to develop complex ecosystem models.},

@article{Flynn2010,
abstract = {Traditionally models of oceanic pelagic ecology, which also lay at the heart of general circulation models used for climate change simulations and of models describing coastal ecosystem dynamics have employed descriptions of plankton that assume fixed Redfield elemental compositions as inputs for rectangular-hyperbolic (Monod-type, Holling type II) descriptions of resource-limited growth and predation kinetics. The performances of Redfield-Monod and variable stoichiometric models are compared with theoretical expectations and experimental data for descriptions of multi-nutrient limited phytoplankton growth and predator-prey interactions. Serious deficiencies are revealed in Redfield-Monod implementations; such constructs have outputs and/or structural logic contrary to empirical biological knowledge. For example, Redfield-Monod models often employ nutrient limitation as a significant factor controlling phytoplankton growth, and yet biologically such nutrient limitation is associated with significant variation in elemental stoichiometry. One could argue that reliance on such dysfunctional descriptions is unacceptable, especially in an era when increasing political play is made of model simulations and predictions. Biological studies should examine the consumption and fate of all major nutrients, not just of the limiting nutrient, in order to furnish modellers with the mechanistic understanding, and data, to enable a refined description of the organisms responsible for biogeochemical cycling. Modellers, in turn, should embrace existing experimental and phenomenological observations and update their models accordingly. Simplifications in model structure can then be made from a sound knowledge base rather than by making potentially incorrect a priori assumptions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Smith2014,
abstract = {The value of mechanistic ecosystem modelling has long been appreciated, and in con-nection with trait-based approaches it has recently stimulated a more process-based understanding of adaptive capacities and trade-offs. Notwithstanding recent advances, even sophisticated state-of-the-art models of plankton ecosystems, some of which include hundreds of idealized species, do not accurately represent the great biodiver-sity of plankton, or the associated flexible adaptive response of plankton communities. We build on previous reviews to suggest that it may be necessary to discard some common assumptions and try new approaches in order to construct models that can make new and testable predictions about the " adaptive capacity " of plankton ecosys-tems. Major challenges remain unresolved for modelling interacting communities of producers and consumers. Rather than the common approach of mixing and match-ing existing model components, each laden with its own legacy assumptions, we suggest that a judicious combination of innovative, mechanistic approaches that combine traits and trade-offs will likely better address such challenges. If we are to understand the potential impacts of climate change, or other environmental changes, on marine eco-systems and the biogeochemical cycles that they mediate, we need plankton ecosystem models that can represent realistically the adaptive response of diverse communities. A previous " Horizons " article (Franks, 2009) addressed the " Perplexing parameterizations and a failure to fail " in planktonic ecosystem modelling and suggested the need to develop models that scale from the adaptive response of individual organisms to the community response of ecosys-tems. Building on these suggestions, and on more recent reviews of advances in trait-based (Follows and Dutkiewicz, 2011) and optimality-based (Smith et al., 2011) modelling, we address more specifically the need to break free from assumptions and approaches that hinder the ability to model the adaptive response and biodiversity of plankton ecosystems. We intend to encourage innov-ation of new interpretations for observations and new model formulations, even though this may, often incorrect-ly, be considered more risky (and more difficult to publish) than straightforward application of the " well accepted " . Traits and the trade-offs among them play central roles in modelling the adaptive response of planktonic ecosys-tems (Follows and Dutkiewicz, 2011; Smith et al., 2011). Traits, which define the response of each species to envir-onmental conditions (Fig. 1), are the result of evolution by natural selection, operating subject to constraints, which are broadly termed trade-offs. The distribution of traits within a community defines its functional biodiversity and adaptive capacity. Therefore, it is crucial that traits and trade-offs are identified and quantified accurately. In this context, we first briefly discuss the legacy as-sumption of Michaelis– Menten kinetics for nutrient uptake by phytoplankton and how it led recently to the mis-identification of a putative trade-off for nutrient uptake. Then we address the legacy assumption of strong diffusive limitation of phytoplankton at low nutrient con-centrations. Next, we discuss more recent and promising developments that have advanced our understanding by accounting explicitly for the size-scaling of nutrient uptake traits in theoretical models. As a final example we discuss a legacy assumption about the cost of foraging by zooplankton in terms of energy dissipation in the sur-rounding water. Common to all these examples is the change in perspective that we gain by combining trait-based approaches with the fundamental principles of optimal resource allocation subject to trade-offs. Lastly, we elaborate on some ideas intended to foster progress in modelling the adaptive capacity of plankton ecosystems.},

abstract = {A key challenge to progressing our understanding of biodiversity's role in the sustenance of ecosystem function is the extrapolation of the results of two decades of dedicated empirical research to regional, global and future landscapes. Ecosystem models provide a platform for this progression, potentially offering a holistic view of ecosystems where, guided by the mechanistic understanding of processes and their connection to the environment and biota, large-scale questions can be investigated. While the benefits of depicting biodiversity in such models are widely recognized, its application is limited by difficulties in the transfer of knowledge from small process oriented ecology into macro-scale modelling. Here, we build on previous work, breaking down key challenges of that knowledge transfer into a tangible framework, highlighting successful strategies that both modelling and ecology communities have developed to better interact with one another. We use a benthic and a pelagic case-study to illustrate how aspects of the links between biodiversity and ecosystem process have been depicted in marine ecosystem models (ERSEM and MIRO), from data, to conceptualisation and model development. We hope that this framework may help future interactions between biodiversity researchers and model developers by highlighting concrete solutions to common problems, and in this way contribute to the advance of the mechanistic understanding of the role of biodiversity in marine (and terrestrial) ecosystems.},

@article{Shimoda2016,
abstract = {In the context of aquatic biogeochemical modelling, there is an increasing pressure to explicitly treat multiple biogeochemical cycles and to increase the functional diversity of biotic communities. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of 124 aquatic biogeochemical models to reproduce the dynamics of phytoplankton functional groups. Our analysis reinforces earlier findings that aquatic ecosystem modellers do not seem to consistently apply conventional methodological steps during the development of their models. Although there is an improvement relative to earlier critiques, significant portion of published studies did not properly assess model sensitivity to input vectors; aquatic ecosystem modellers are still reluctant to embrace optimization techniques during model calibration; and assess the ability of their models to support predictions in the extrapolation domain. We also found significant variability with respect to the mathematical representation of key physiological processes (e.g., growth strategies, nutrient kinetics, settling velocities) as well as group-specific characterizations typically considered in the pertinent literature. Cyanobacteria blooms are a major concern for water industries as they represent high risk for human health and economic costs for drinking water treatment, and thus one of the outstanding challenges is to offer credible modelling tools that can serve as early warning systems to assist with the operational control of cyanobacteria blooms. Our study suggests that the derivation of distinct functional groups from fairly heterogeneous planktonic assemblages poses challenging problems. Because of the still poorly understood ecology, we do not have robust group-specific parameterizations that can support predictions in a wide array of spatiotemporal domains. In this context, we argue that the most prudent strategies are the gradual incorporation of complexity, where possible and relevant, along with an open dialogue on how we can mathematically depict the interconnections among different phytoplankton subunits or even how we can frame the suitable data collection efforts.},

abstract = {As a first step toward the development of coupled, basin scale models of ocean circulation and biogeochemical cycling, we present a model of the annual cycles of plankton dynamics and nitrogen cycling in the oceanic mixed layer. The model is easily modified and runs in FOR- TRAN on a personal computer. In our initial development and exploration of the model's behavior we have concentrated on modeling the annual cycle at Station "S" near Bermuda using seven compartments (Phytoplankton, Zooplankton, Bacteria, Nitrate, Ammonium, Dissolved organic nitrogen and Detritus). This choice of compartments and the attendant flows (fluxes or intercompartmental exchanges) permits a functional distinction between new and regenerated production. We have examined over 200 different runs and carried out sensitivity analyses. Results of model runs with detrital sinking rates of I and 10 meters per day are presented. In these runs, the phytoplankton biomass-specific mortality rate was varied to adjust the annual net primary production (NPP) for the mixed layer to a value equivalent to 45 gC m-2, which was calculated from the literature. Modelled cycles of zooplankton and bacterial stocks, and magnitudes of their annual production which cannot be validated due to sparse observations, are driven by the amplitude of the spring bloom and by changes in foodweb structure. Most, but not all model runs exhibit a spring bloom triggered by the winter depression of zooplankton stocks and the vernal increase in solar irradiance. The bloom is driven by nitrate entrained into the mixed layer during the wintertime deepening of the mixed layer. Following the shoaling of the pycnocline to ca 20 m, nitrate supply is limited to diffusional inputs, nitrate stocks are depleted, and regenerated production exceeds new production. The resulting cycles of new and regener- ated production produce an annual cycle of the f-ratio with winter maxima approaching 0.8-0.9 and summer minima reaching ca 0.1-0.2, with annual values averaging 0.7. The model reproduces the "Eppley Curve," a hyperbolic relationship of increasing f with increasing primary production. This curve is shown to be the trajectory of the production system in the f-NPP phase plane. These model runs reproduce the annual cycles of areal NPP, and average annual NPP, new production, and particulate N flux values reported in the literature. The model demonstrates that currently accepted values for these annual fluxes can be reconciled only if the f-ratio has a high annual average. At present, the annual averagef-ratio is poorly quantified due to severe undersampling in fall and winter. Our model's ecological structure has been success- fully incorporated into the Princeton general circulation model for the North Atlantic Ocean. The behavior of the 7-compartment model at high latitudes and at the equator, and the properties of 9-compartment models with two size classes of phytoplankton and grazers, are now being examined.},

A model of an annual cycle, representing two or more groups of phytoplankton but only one type each of nutrient and herbivore, can exhibit seasonal succession of two groups, and coexistence of three. It shows some of the features common to many instances of succession. Although the model's physical environment repeats exactly from year to year, its plankton populations commonly oscillate with a period of 2 yr or longer. Models with a single, undifferentiated phytoplankton component may overestimate the predictability of plankton populations.},

@article{Fleming1939,
abstract = {1. The importance of grazing by zooplankton organisms in the control of diatom populations in the sea is emphasized. The discussion deals especially with the development of a large population in a given water mass and its subsequent disappearance due to grazing. 2. The treatment is based on the following assumptions; first, that the diatoms continue to divide at a constant rate; second, that the fraction of the population removed each day by grazing increases. 3. An equation is developed which represents the form of the diatom population curve. The shape of this curve is determined by the ratio of the maximum to the initial population and the time required for the development of the maximum population. 4. If the division rate of the diatoms is known, it is possible to determine the grazing fraction. The grazing fraction is the fraction of the population removed in one day. 5. An equation is developed for computing the total production of diatoms for any interval between the initial time and the time when the population passes through the maximum and returns to the initial value. 6. The equations developed are applied to observations from the English Channel for the spring of 1934. The computed production agrees excellently with estimates based on phosphate utilization. 7. The relation between the grazing fraction and the total filtra- tion volume is shown. The total filtration volume depends upon the type of grazing organisms and their capacity to filter a given volume of water per day regardless of its food content.},

@article{Gentleman2002a,
abstract = {Research on plankton ecology in the oceans has traditionally been conducted via two scientific approaches: in situ (in the field) and in vitro (in the laboratory). There is, however, a third approach: exploring plankton dynamics in silico, or using computer models as tools to study marine ecosystems. Models have been used for this purpose for over 60 years, and the innovations and implementations of historical studies provide a context for how future model applications can continue to advance our understanding. To that end, this paper presents a chronology of the in silico approach to plankton dynamics, beginning with modeling pioneers who worked in the days before computers. During the first 30 years of automated computation, plankton modeling focused on formulations for biological processes and investigations of community structure. The changing technological context and conceptual paradigms of the late-1970s and 1980s resulted in simulations becoming more widespread research tools for biological oceanographers. This period saw rising use of models as hypothesis-testing tools, and means of exploring the effects of circulation on spatial distributions of organisms. Continued computer advances and increased availability of data in the 1990s allowed old approaches to be applied to old and new problems, and led to developments of new approaches. Much of the modeling in the new millennium so far has incorporated these sophistications, and many cutting-edge applications have come from a new generation of plankton scientists who were trained by modeling gurus of previous eras. The future directions for modeling plankton dynamics are rooted in the historical studies.},

abstract = {Biogeochemical cycling in marine systems is intimately linked to the activity of specific plankton functional types (PFTs) such as diatoms, coccolithophores and nitrogen fixers, thereby providing a focus for contemporary modelling studies. Incorporating extra complexity beyond simple nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus (NPZD) models is, however, fraught with difficulties: poorly understood ecology; lack of data; aggregating diversity within functional groups into meaningful state variables and constants; sensitivity of output to the parameterizations in question and their physical and chemical environment. Although regional models addressing the seasonal succession of plankton types have achieved some degree of success, predicted distributions of PFTs in global biogeochemical models have thus far been less than convincing. While the continued articulation of detail in ecosystem models is surely the way forward, I argue that this can only be so with due care and attention to the formulations employed and a healthy dose of scepticism regarding model outcomes. Future directions should emphasize building up complexity gradually, objective assessment of the resulting parameterizations, and variety in approach such as the use of empirical alternatives to the fully dynamic representation of PFTs in models.},

abstract = {Ecosystem processes are important determinants of the biogeochemistry of the ocean, and they can be profoundly affected by changes in climate. Ocean models currently express ecosystem processes through empirically derived parameterizations that tightly link key geochemical tracers to ocean physics. The explicit inclusion of ecosystem processes in models will permit ecological changes to be taken into account, and will allow us to address several important questions, including the causes of observed glacial-interglacial changes in atmospheric trace gases and aerosols, and how the oceanic uptake of CO(2) is likely to change in the future. There is an urgent need to assess our mechanistic understanding of the environmental factors that exert control over marine ecosystems, and to represent their natural complexity based on theoretical understanding. We present a prototype design for a Dynamic Green Ocean Model (DGOM) based on the identification of (a) key plankton functional types that need to be simulated explicitly to capture important biogeochemical processes in the ocean; (b) key processes controlling the growth and mortality of these functional types and hence their interactions; and (c) sources of information necessary to parameterize each of these processes within a modeling framework. We also develop a strategy for model evaluation, based on simulation of both past and present mean state and variability, and identify potential sources of validation data for each. Finally, we present a DGOM-based strategy for addressing key questions in ocean biogeochemistry. This paper thus presents ongoing work in ocean biogeochemical modeling, which, it is hoped will motivate international collaborations to improve our understanding of the role of the ocean in the climate system.},

@article{Gregg2003,
abstract = {The JGOFS program and NASA ocean-color satellites have provided a wealth of data that can be used to test and validate models of ocean biogeochemistry. A coupled three-dimensional general circulation, biogeochemical, and radiative model of the global oceans was validated using these in situ data sources and satellite data sets. Biogeochemical processes in the model were determined from the influences of circulation and turbulence dynamics, irradiance availability, and the interactions among four phytoplankton functional groups (diatoms, chlorophytes, cyanobacteria, and coccolithophores) and four nutrients (nitrate, ammonium, silica, and dissolved iron). Annual mean log-transformed dissolved iron concentrations in the model were statistically positively correlated on basin scale with observations (P {\textless} 0.05) over the eight (out of 12) major oceanographic basins where data were available. The model tended to overestimate in situ observations, except in the Antarctic where a large underestimate occurred. Inadequate scavenging and excessive remineralization and/or regeneration were possible reasons for the overestimation. Basin scale model chlorophyll seasonal distributions were positively correlated with SeaWiFS chlorophyll in each of the 12 oceanographic basins (P {\textless} 0.05). The global mean difference was 3.9{\%} (model higher than SeaWiFS). The four phytoplankton groups were initialized as homogeneous and equal distributions throughout the model domain. After 26 years of simulation, they arrived at reasonable distributions throughout the global oceans: diatoms predominated high latitudes, coastal, and equatorial upwelling areas, cyanobacteria predominated the mid-ocean gyres, and chlorophytes and coccolithophores represented transitional assemblages. Seasonal patterns exhibited a range of relative responses: from a seasonal succession in the North Atlantic with coccolithophores replacing diatoms as the dominant group in mid-summer, to successional patterns with cyanobacteria replacing diatoms in mid-summer in the central North Pacific. Diatoms were associated with regions where nutrient availability was high. Cyanobacteria predominated in quiescent regions with low nutrients. While the overall patterns of phytoplankton functional group distributions exhibited broad qualitative agreement with in situ data, quantitative comparisons were mixed. Three of the four phytoplankton groups exhibited statistically significant correspondence across basins. Diatoms did not. Some basins exhibited excellent correspondence, while most showed moderate agreement, with two functional groups in agreement with data and the other two in disagreement. The results are encouraging for a first attempt at simulating functional groups in a global coupled three-dimensional model but many issues remain. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Human activity is causing wild populations to experience rapid trait change and local extirpation. The resulting effects on intraspecific variation could have substantial consequences for ecological processes and ecosystem services. Although researchers have long acknowledged that variation among species influences the surrounding environment, only recently has evidence accumulated for the ecological importance of variation within species. We conducted a meta-analysis comparing the ecological effects of variation within a species (intraspecific effects) with the effects of replacement or removal of that species (species effects). We evaluated direct and indirect ecological responses, including changes in abundance (or biomass), rates of ecological processes and changes in community composition. Our results show that intraspecific effects are often comparable to, and sometimes stronger than, species effects. Species effects tend to be larger for direct ecological responses (for example, through consumption), whereas intraspecific effects and species effects tend to be similar for indirect responses (for example, through trophic cascades). Intraspecific effects are especially strong when indirect interactions alter community composition. Our results summarize data from the first generation of studies examining the relative ecological effects of intraspecific variation. Our conclusions can help inform the design of future experiments and the formulation of strategies to quantify and conserve biodiversity.},

We show that such an approach, augmented by a mechanistic analysis of trade-offs among functional traits, can be successfully used to explain community composition of marine phytoplankton along environmental gradients. Our analysis of literature on major functional traits in phytoplankton, such as parameters of nutrient-dependent growth and uptake, reveals physiological trade-offs in species abilities to acquire and utilize resources. These trade-offs, arising from fundamental relations such as cellular scaling laws and enzyme kinetics, define contrasting ecological strategies of nutrient acquisition. Major groups of marine eukaryotic phytoplankton have adopted distinct strategies with associated traits. These diverse strategies of nutrient utilization can explain the distribution patterns of major functional groups and size classes along nutrient availability gradients.},

abstract = {The development of mechanistic, predictive ecological theory will entail the explicit inclusion of organismal tradeoffs, of environmental constraints, and of the basic mechanisms of interspecific interaction. This approach was used to address the causes of species dominance and successional dynamics in sandplain vegetation in Minne- sota. A series of field experiments performed over the last eight years have shown that the major constraints on plants were soil nitrogen and disturbance, with nitrogen competition being a major force. Nutrients other than nitrogen (P, K, Ca, Mg, S and trace metals), herbivory, and light were of minor importance. As predicted by theory, the superior nitrogen competitors were the species that, when growing in long-term monocultures in the field, lowered soil extractable N the most. These species had high root biomass and low tissue N levels. Seven alternative hypotheses of succession, each named after its underlying tradeoff, were proposed and tested. The colonization - nutrient competition hypothesis pro- vided the best explanation for the initial dominance (years 0 to 40) of herbs, whereas the nutrient versus light competition hypothesis best explained the long-term dom- inance by woody plants. Hypotheses involving transient dynamics caused by differ- ences in maximal growth rates were rejected. In total, the results demonstrate that the inclusion of simple mechanisms of interspecific interactions, and of allocation- based tradeoffs, can allow models to predict the composition and successional dy- namics of vegetation},

@article{Iglesias-Rodriguez2002,
abstract = {Carbonates are the largest reservoirs of carbon on Earth. From mid-Mesozoic time, the biologically catalyzed precipitation of calcium carbonates by pelagic phytoplankton has been primarily due to the production of calcite by coccolithophorids. In this paper we address the physical and chemical processes that select for coccolithophorid blooms detected in Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) ocean color imagery. Our primary goal is to develop both diagnostic and prognostic models that represent the spatial and temporal dynamics of coccolithophorid blooms in order to improve our knowledge of the role of these organisms in mediating fluxes of carbon between the ocean, the atmosphere, and the lithosphere. On the basis of monthly composite images of classified coccolithophorid blooms and global climatological maps of physical variables and nutrient fields, we developed a probability density function that accounts for the physical chemical variables that predict the spatiotemporal distribution of coccolithophorids in the world oceans. Our analysis revealed that areas with sea surface temperatures (SST) between 3° and 15°C, a critical irradiance between 25 and 150 µmol quanta m-2 s-1, and decreasing nitrate concentrations (N/t {\textless} 0) are selective for upper ocean large-scale coccolithophorid blooms. While these conditions favor both Northern and Southern Hemisphere blooms of the most abundant coccolithophorid in the modern oceans, Emiliania huxleyi, the Northern and Southern Hemisphere populations of this organism are genetically distinct. Applying amplified fragment length polymorphism as a marker of genetic diversity, we identified two major taxonomic clades of E. huxleyi; one is associated with the Northern Hemisphere blooms, while the other is found in the Southern Hemisphere. We suggest a rule of “universal distribution and local selection”: that is, coccolithophorids can be considered cosmopolitan taxa, but their genetic plasticity provides physiological accommodation to local environmental selection pressure. Sea surface temperature, critical irradiance, and N/t were predicted for the years 2060–2070 using the NCAR Community Climate System Model to generate future monthly probability distributions of coccolithophorids based upon the relationships observed between the environmental variables and coccolithophorid blooms in modern oceans. Our projected probability distribution analysis suggests that in the North Atlantic, the largest habitat for coccolithophorids on Earth, the areal extent of blooms will decrease by up to 50{\%} by the middle of this century. We discuss how the magnitude of carbon fluxes may be affected by the evolutionary success of coccolithophorids in future climate scenarios.},

@article{Violle2007c,
abstract = {In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for a long time. Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term “trait” itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the “performance paradigm” to plant ecology. “Functional traits” are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing “integration functions” which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

Phytoplankton communities, with a rich history, as model systems in community, ecology, are ideally suited for applying and further developing these concepts. Here we summarize the essential components of trait-based approaches and review their historical and potential application to illuminating phytoplankton community ecology Major ecological axes relevant to phytoplankton include light and nutrient acquisition and use, natural enemy interactions, morphological variation, temperature sensitivity, and modes of reproduction. Trade-offs between these traits play key roles in determining community structure. Freshwater and marine environments may select fora different suite of traits owing to their different physical and chemical properties. We describe mathematical techniques for integrating traits into measures of growth and fitness and predicting how community structure varies along environmental gradients. Finally, we outline challenges and future directions for the application of trait-based approaches to phytoplankton ecology},

Models describe phytoplankton functional types by a set of traits that determine their growth rates or fitness. Traits for functional types are often determined from observations on a small number of species under laboratory conditions. Functional types can be composed of a large number of species with very different trait values, so the representation of a type by an average trait value may not be appropriate. A potential solution is to estimate trait values from observations of the aggregate biomass of phytoplankton functional types in natural populations. We report on some recent efforts to extract trait values from time-series data using Bayesian statistical models and discuss some challenges of this approach.},

@article{Fasham1990a,
abstract = {As a first step toward the development of coupled, basin scale models of ocean circulation and biogeochemical cycling, we present a model of the annual cycles of plankton dynamics and nitrogen cycling in the oceanic mixed layer. The model is easily modified and runs in FOR- TRAN on a personal computer. In our initial development and exploration of the model's behavior we have concentrated on modeling the annual cycle at Station "S" near Bermuda using seven compartments (Phytoplankton, Zooplankton, Bacteria, Nitrate, Ammonium, Dissolved organic nitrogen and Detritus). This choice of compartments and the attendant flows (fluxes or intercompartmental exchanges) permits a functional distinction between new and regenerated production. We have examined over 200 different runs and carried out sensitivity analyses. Results of model runs with detrital sinking rates of I and 10 meters per day are presented. In these runs, the phytoplankton biomass-specific mortality rate was varied to adjust the annual net primary production (NPP) for the mixed layer to a value equivalent to 45 gC m-2, which was calculated from the literature. Modelled cycles of zooplankton and bacterial stocks, and magnitudes of their annual production which cannot be validated due to sparse observations, are driven by the amplitude of the spring bloom and by changes in foodweb structure. Most, but not all model runs exhibit a spring bloom triggered by the winter depression of zooplankton stocks and the vernal increase in solar irradiance. The bloom is driven by nitrate entrained into the mixed layer during the wintertime deepening of the mixed layer. Following the shoaling of the pycnocline to ca 20 m, nitrate supply is limited to diffusional inputs, nitrate stocks are depleted, and regenerated production exceeds new production. The resulting cycles of new and regener- ated production produce an annual cycle of the f-ratio with winter maxima approaching 0.8-0.9 and summer minima reaching ca 0.1-0.2, with annual values averaging 0.7. The model reproduces the "Eppley Curve," a hyperbolic relationship of increasing f with increasing primary production. This curve is shown to be the trajectory of the production system in the f-NPP phase plane. These model runs reproduce the annual cycles of areal NPP, and average annual NPP, new production, and particulate N flux values reported in the literature. The model demonstrates that currently accepted values for these annual fluxes can be reconciled only if the f-ratio has a high annual average. At present, the annual averagef-ratio is poorly quantified due to severe undersampling in fall and winter. Our model's ecological structure has been success- fully incorporated into the Princeton general circulation model for the North Atlantic Ocean. The behavior of the 7-compartment model at high latitudes and at the equator, and the properties of 9-compartment models with two size classes of phytoplankton and grazers, are now being examined.},

@article{Acevedo-Trejos2016,
abstract = {Biodiversity is one of the key mechanisms that facilitate the adaptive response of planktonic communities to a fluctuating environment. How to allow for such a flexible response in marine ecosystem models is, however, not entirely clear. One particular way is to resolve the natural complexity of phytoplankton communities by explicitly incorporating a large number of species or plankton functional types. Alternatively, models of aggregate community properties focus on macroecological quantities such as total biomass, mean trait, and trait variance (or functional trait diversity), thus reducing the observed natural complexity to a few mathematical expressions. We developed the modelling tool PhytoSFDM, which can resolve species discretely and can capture aggregate community properties. The tool also provides a set of methods for treating diversity under realistic oceanographic settings. This model is coded in Python and is distributed as an open-source software. PhytoSFDM is implemented in a 0D physical scheme and can be applied to any location of the world oceans. We show that aggregate-community models reduce computational complexity while preserving relevant macroecological features of phytoplankton communities. Compared to species-explicit models, aggregate models are more manageable in terms of number of equations and have faster computational times. Further developments of this tool should address the caveats associated with the assumptions of aggregate community models and on implementations into spatially resolved physical settings (1D and 3D). With PhytoSFDM we embrace the idea of promoting open source software and encourage scientists to build on this modelling tool to further improve our understanding of the role that biodiversity plays in shaping marine ecosystems.},

Statistical modes of ocean variability and their characteristic interannual to multi-decadal timescales over the last century are described. Recent in situ and satellite time-series of primary production can be clearly linked to interannual ocean variability. Global marine primary production appears to have increased over the past several decades in association with multi-decadal variations. A paleoclimate record extends discussion to the centennial scale, providing contrasting insights into how marine primary production might vary in the future.},

@article{Boyce2012,
abstract = {Understanding large-scale phytoplankton dynamics requires accurate, multi-decadal measurements of abundance and distribution. Since 1890, marine phytoplankton abundance has been assessed using a diverse range of sensors and observational platforms, and inter-calibrating these data have been challenging. Consequently, syntheses of historical phytoplankton data have been rarely attempted, and the need for accurate,long-term assessments of phytoplankton abundance and distribution is commonly acknowledged. Here, we derive quantitative indices of phytoplankton abundance from measurements of upper ocean transparency and color-calibrated with direct measurements of surface chlorophyll. The strong correlation and linear scaling of the predicted data enabled the construction of a comprehensive, globally intercalibrated chlorophyll time series from 1890 to 2010. The calibrated chlorophyll data reproduced the well established spatial features of phytoplankton surface biomass and were strongly correlated with chlorophyll concentration derived from two independent remote sensing platforms discontinuously available since 1978. These results suggest that with careful statistical treatment it is possible to generate a globally integrated chlorophyll time series extending 120 years into the past. This database, which is available in the web appendices of this paper, may enable new insights in the areas of climate science, biogeochemical cycling, and marine ecosystem structure and functioning over the past century.},

abstract = {Particulate organic carbon (POC) is vertically transported to the oceanic interior by aggregates and their ballasts, mainly CaCO 3 and biogenic opal, with a smaller role for lithogenic aerosols through the mesopelagic zone. Diel migrating zooplankton communities effect vertical transport and remineralization of POC in the upper layers of the ocean. Below 1.5 km, the presence of zooplankton is reduced and thus the aggregates travel mainly by gravitational transport. We normalized the fluxes of POC, CaCO 3 , and biogenic opal from data published on samples collected at 134 globally distributed, bottom-tethered, time-series sediment trap (TS-trap) stations to annual mole fluxes at the mesopelagic/bathypelagic boundary (m/b) at 2 km and defined them as F m/b C org , F m/b C inorg , and F m/b Si bio . Using this global data set, we investigated (1) the geographic contrasts of POC export at m/b and (2) the supply rate of ∑CO 2 to the world mesopelagic water column. F m/b C org varies from 25 (Pacific Warm Pool) to 605 (divergent Arabian Sea) mmolC m -2 yr -1 ; F m/b C inorg varies from {\textgreater}8 (high latitude Polar Oceans) or 15 (Pacific Warm Pool) to 459 (divergent Arabian Sea) mmolC m -2 yr -1 ; and F m/b Si bio , the most spatially/temporally variable flux, ranges from 6 (North Atlantic Drift) to 1118 (Pacific Subarctic Gyre) mmolSi m -2 yr -1 . The oceanic region exhibiting the highest POC flux over a significantly large region is the area of the North Pacific Boreal Gyres where the average F m/b C org = 213, F m/b C inorg = 126, and F m/b Si bio = 578 mmol m -2 yr -1 . F m/b C org and F m/b C inorg are particularly high in large upwelling margins, including the divergent Arabian Sea and off Cape Verde. One of the data sets showing the lowest flux over a significant region/basin is F m/b C org = 39, F m/b C inorg = 69, and F m/b Si bio = 22 mmol m -2 yr -1 in the North Pacific subtropical/tropical gyres; Pan-Atlantic average fluxes are similar except F m/b Si bio fluxes are even lower. Where C org /C inorg and Si bio /C inorg are {\textless}1 defines the "Carbonate Ocean", and where these ratios are ≥1 defines the "Silica Ocean". The Carbonate Ocean occupies about 80{\%} of the present world pelagic ocean between the two major oceanographic fronts, the North Pacific Polar Front and the Antarctic Polar Front, and the Silica Ocean is found on the polar sides of these fronts. The total global annual fluxes of F m/b C org , F m/b C inorg , and F m/b Si bio at m/b calculated by parameterizations of the export flux data from 134 stations are surprisingly similar; 36.2, 33.8, and 34.6 teramol yr -1 (120, 112, and 114 mmol m -2 yr -1 ), respectively, resulting in a near uniform binary ratio between the above three elements of about one. The global ternary {\%} ratios estimated from 152 TS-trap samples of the three elements are 35:32:33. From our global F m/b C org and a published model estimate of the global export production, we estimate the regeneration rate of CO 2 through the mesopelagic zone by the biological pump is 441 teramolC yr -1 . Based on our global F m/b C inorg and recently estimated global primary production of PIC, 36-86 teramolC yr -1 of PIC is assumed to be dissolved within the upper 2 km of the water column. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Photosynthesis fuels marine food webs, yet differences in fish catch across globally distributed marine ecosystems far exceed differences in net primary production (NPP). We consider the hypothesis that ecosystem-level variations in pelagic and benthic energy flows from phytoplankton to fish, trophic transfer efficien- cies, and fishing effort can quantitatively reconcile this contrast in an energetically consistent manner. To test this hypothesis, we enlist global fish catch data that include previously neglected contributions from small-scale fisheries, a synthesis of global fishing effort, and plankton food web energy flux estimates from a prototype high-resolution global earth system model (ESM). After removing a small number of lightly fished ecosystems, stark interregional differences in fish catch per unit area can be explained (r = 0.79) with an energy-based model that (i) considers dynamic interregional differences in benthic and pelagic energy pathways connecting phytoplankton and fish, (ii) depresses trophic transfer efficiencies in the tropics and, less critically, (iii) associates elevated trophic transfer efficiencies with benthic-predominant systems. Model catch estimates are generally within a factor of 2 of values spanning two orders of magnitude. Climate change projections show that the same macroecological patterns explaining dramatic regional catch differences in the contemporary ocean amplify catch trends, producing changes that may exceed 50{\%}in some regions by the end of the 21st century under high-emissions scenarios. Models failing to resolve these trophodynamic patterns may significantly underestimate regional fisheries catch trends and hinder adaptation to climate change},

Cyst production is interpreted in the context of physico-chemical properties measured in situ at the mooring site (primarily reflecting seasonal upwelling), and considering potential interactions with other major components of the pelagic food web (e.g., diatoms, ciliates, copepods). The time series consists in {\textgreater}300 sediment trap samples, each representing ∼14 days of sedimentation, collected at the CARIACO station between Nov. 8, 1996 and May 19, 2009. Mass fluxes of biogenic silica, calcium carbonate and organic carbon reflect dominantly the timing and strength of wind-driven, seasonal upwelling that brings colder, nutrient-rich waters to the surface, fostering primary productivity and the export of biogenous materials to the depths. On seasonal time scales, dinoflagellate cyst production is closely coupled with upwelling strength, with higher cyst fluxes consistently observed under active upwelling conditions (average of 50.5 × 103 cysts m−2 day−1) compared to non-active upwelling intervals (29.0 × 103 cysts m−2 day−1). Year-to-year variability is characterized by a large increase in cyst production observed over the last ∼4 years of the time series (2006–2009) and minimum cyst fluxes recorded in the years 1998 and 1999, following the strong 1997/98 El Ni{\~{n}}o event. Dinoflagellate cyst assemblages are dominated by Brigantedinium spp. (59.1{\%}), accompanied by Echinidinium delicatum (10.8{\%}), Bitectatodinium spongium (8.4{\%}), Spiny brown type A (2.9{\%}) and Echinidinium spp. (2.4{\%}). Cyst produced by both autotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates generally respond positively to upwelling in the basin. Most cyst taxa are associated with active upwelling conditions (e.g., Bitectatodinium spongium, Brigantedinium spp., Echinidinium delicatum, Quinquecuspis concreta, Selenopemphix quanta, Spiny brown type C), with some showing higher fluxes under active but weak upwelling conditions (e.g., Echinidinium granulatum, Echinidinium spp., cyst of P. fukuyoi, Spiny brown type A). Other cyst taxa tend to show higher abundances at the onset of upwelling conditions (e.g., Echinidinium aculeatum, cyst of Protoperidinium stellatum) or following active upwelling intervals (e.g., Lejeunecysta marieae, Selenopemphix nephroides). The detailed response of each dinoflagellate cyst taxon to environmental variability is presented in the form of an atlas, providing photomicrographs and detailing overall monthly production, contribution to the total trap assemblage as well as cyst production over the 12.5 years of the time series.},

abstract = {Global increases in atmospheric CO2 and temperature are associated with changes in ocean chemistry and circulation, altering light and nutrient regimes. Resulting changes in phytoplankton community structure are expected to have a cascading effect on primary and export production, food web dynamics and the structure of the marine food web as well the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and bio-limiting elements in the sea. A review of current literature indicates cell size and elemental stoichiometry often respond predictably to abiotic conditions and follow biophysical rules that link environmental conditions to growth rates, and growth rates to food web interactions, and consequently to the biogeochemical cycling of elements. This suggests that cell size and elemental stoichiometry are promising ecophysiological traits for modelling and tracking changes in phytoplankton community structure in response to climate change. In turn, these changes are expected to have further impacts on phytoplankton community structure through as yet poorly understood secondary processes associated with trophic dynamics.},

@article{Falkowski2004a,
abstract = {The community structure and ecological function of contemporary marine ecosystems are critically dependent on eukaryotic phytoplankton. Although numerically inferior to cyanobacteria, these organisms are responsible for the majority of the flux of organic matter to higher trophic levels and the ocean interior. Photosynthetic eukaryotes evolved more than 1.5 billion years ago in the Proterozoic oceans. However, it was not until the Mesozoic Era (251 to 65 million years ago) that the three principal phytoplankton clades that would come to dominate the modern seas rose to ecological prominence. In contrast to their pioneering predecessors, the dinoflagellates, coccolithophores, and diatoms all contain plastids derived from an ancestral red alga by secondary symbiosis. Here we examine the geological, geochemical, and biological processes that contributed to the rise of these three, distantly related, phytoplankton groups.},

@article{Field2009,
abstract = {Integrating conceptually similar models of the growth of marine and terrestrial primary producers yielded an estimated global net primary production (NPP) of 104.9 petagrams of carbon per year, with roughly equal contributions from land and oceans. Approaches based on satellite indices of absorbed solar radiation indicate marked heterogeneity in NPP for both land and oceans, reflecting the influence of physical and ecological processes. The spatial and temporal distributions of ocean NPP are consistent with primary limitation by light, nutrients, and temperature. On land, water limitation imposes additional constraints. On land and ocean, progressive changes in NPP can result in altered carbon storage, although contrasts in mechanisms of carbon storage and rates of organic matter turnover result in a range of relations between carbon storage and changes in NPP.},

@article{Flynn2010,
abstract = {Traditionally models of oceanic pelagic ecology, which also lay at the heart of general circulation models used for climate change simulations and of models describing coastal ecosystem dynamics have employed descriptions of plankton that assume fixed Redfield elemental compositions as inputs for rectangular-hyperbolic (Monod-type, Holling type II) descriptions of resource-limited growth and predation kinetics. The performances of Redfield-Monod and variable stoichiometric models are compared with theoretical expectations and experimental data for descriptions of multi-nutrient limited phytoplankton growth and predator-prey interactions. Serious deficiencies are revealed in Redfield-Monod implementations; such constructs have outputs and/or structural logic contrary to empirical biological knowledge. For example, Redfield-Monod models often employ nutrient limitation as a significant factor controlling phytoplankton growth, and yet biologically such nutrient limitation is associated with significant variation in elemental stoichiometry. One could argue that reliance on such dysfunctional descriptions is unacceptable, especially in an era when increasing political play is made of model simulations and predictions. Biological studies should examine the consumption and fate of all major nutrients, not just of the limiting nutrient, in order to furnish modellers with the mechanistic understanding, and data, to enable a refined description of the organisms responsible for biogeochemical cycling. Modellers, in turn, should embrace existing experimental and phenomenological observations and update their models accordingly. Simplifications in model structure can then be made from a sound knowledge base rather than by making potentially incorrect a priori assumptions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Coupled biological-physical models of carbon-nitrogen cycling by phytoplankton, zooplankton, and bacteria asses the impacts of nitogen fixation and upwelled nitrate during new production within the shelf environs of the Cariaco Basin. During spring upwelling in response to a mean winf forcing of 8 m s-1, the physical model matches remote-sensing and hydrographic estimates of surface temperature. Within the three-dimensional flow field, the steady solutions of the biological model of a simple food web of diatoms, adult calanoid copepods, and ammonifying/nitrifying bacteria approximate within 9{\%} the mean spring observations of settling fluxes caught by a sediment trap at 240 m, moored at our time series site in the basin. The models also estimate within 11{\%} the average 14C net primary production and mimic the sparse observations of the spatial fields of nitrate and light penetration durong the same time period of Februar-April. Stocks of colored dissolver organic matter are evidently small and diazotrophy is minimal during spring. In one summer case of the model with weaker winf forcing, however, the simulated net primary production is 14{\%} of that measured in August-September, while the predicted detrial flux is then 30{\%} of the observed. Addition of a cyanophyte state variable, with another source of new nitrogen, would remedy the seasonal deficiencies of the biological model, attributed to use of a single phytoplankton group.},
